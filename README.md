**Intro**
  
This project is going to be a social media website for image-sharing. Users will be able to post photos with captions and interact with others' pictures with a like button. 
  
**Programs**  

The sample profile for this project is on the link below for Figma. The code is written on VSCode and shared through GitHub. I have included a small video introduction for this project using Loom and uploaded to GoogleDrive, below. The next steps will be to add JavaScript to this project.
